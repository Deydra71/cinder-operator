# To be able to use this sample it is necessary to:
# - Have a 3PAR backend with iSCSI support
# - Have the 3PAR credentials in cinder-volume-3par-secrets.yaml
# - Having iscsid and multpathd running on the host (automatically done by this sample)
# - Build a cinder-volume container with the 3parclient cinder driver dependency, make it available in a registry accessible by OpenShift, and set its location in this file's containerImage
#
# There is a sample Dockerfile in the parent directory showing how the cinder-volume container in this containerImage was created.
# The correct way to configure and run the daemons is using `MachineConfig` as shown in `iscsid.yaml` and `multipathd.yaml`, like this sample does.
#
# ATTENTION: After applying this OpenShift nodes will reboot, because of the `MachineConfig` changes and will take a while to recover.
